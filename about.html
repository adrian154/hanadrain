        <h2>how did hanadrain begin?</h2>
        <p>hanadrain was first conceived on a fated, starry, and undeniably shiverful evening on mt. hamilton's very own lick observatory in 2023, where santa clara university's society of physics students, not yet owned by the mischievous and evil leo illing had not yet been appointed head of the club but rather was led by the valiant ivar rydstrom oh beloved captain.</p>
        <p>the two components, hana and drain, had not arrived in the same vessel, meeting only later in the night well after ice breakers and other sorts of introductions had rippled through the decently amassed crowd of curious star gazers.  even still, it was not until after drain had been inaugurated by a certain andrew and a nightful of bonding over similar physics adjacent topics that hanadrain interactions began ramping up in a budding college friendgroup circle that would weave its way through the prolific vgdc and other bay area shenanigans</p>
        <p>from then, as any other amiable relationship would develop, so too did hanadrain interactions grow to daily banter and otherwise babbles, rants, and eventually after a summer of constantly sliding past one another like tectonic plates (which should be stopped, by the way), hanadrain began sleepily finding each other in the hanamobile late at night while exchanging mildly emo tunes and unkowingly but mutual longing for one another</p>
        <p>it wasn't until around october of 2024 that any sort of real communication happened.  not until after little italy did hana make any attempt at communicating interest in drain, which was not exempt from their typical cryptic sort of word sharing.  that's not to say there was no success as the baddie has been bagged, indeed.</p>
        <p>since then, the hanadrain unit moves as a whole, residing at each others' abodes in alternating fashion and as once, which seems to be on its way to change soon for the better!</p>

        <h2>what exactly is the hanadrain unit?</h2>
        <p>erm</p>

        <h2>what is the hanadrain philosophy?</h2>
        <p>we have a philosophy???</p>
