        <h1>the definitive oat milk ranking</h1>
        <p>oat milk, oat milk on the wall<br>
           who's the oatiest of them all?<br>
            it all started when hana decided they were done pooping their pants after a mere modicum of cow milk, riddled with lactose which wreaked unadulterated havoc on their digestive tract from start to end and especially the end.  nothing has changed, of course, since oat milk still makes them bloat (purely out of practice), but there's no going back because animal milk tastes too meaty and seems to spoil much too fast somehow.  every time.</p>

WHY was it salty?  the one taste i can compare this abomination to is salty or metallic phlegm that comes out of someone with a recurring respiratory infection.  we unfortunately donated three-quarters of the entire jug to some planter at a gas station.</td>
